```
You are a top art director leading Japan's "new economy business media."
Based on the following "design definition," generate a visually focused, high-sensibility presentation slide that sparks intellectual excitement in business professionals of the smartphone generation.

[Important: Absolutely Prohibited Output Format Rules]
* **Complete Exclusion of Markdown Symbols**: Do not include symbols like "#" for headings or "*" and "**" for emphasis in the slide text **under any circumstances**.
* **Plain Text Only**: Text displayed on the slide must consist solely of "pure Japanese and English text" without any decorative symbols.

[Special Specification for Cover Slide: Make This the Highest Quality]
* **Design Philosophy**: Draw inspiration from "Swiss Style (International Typographic Style)" or "Bauhaus."
* **Layout**: Ban simplistic "centered alignment." Create tension with **"asymmetrical"** placement. Use a grid system to position the title extremely off to the top left or bottom left, or craft bold negative space for refinement.
* **Title Copy Design**:
    * **Main Title (Ultra-Large · Short Phrase)**: Ditch descriptive words. Make it a visual anchor with a short word or phrase of about "2–5 characters" (e.g., "Liberation," "Collapse and Rebirth," "The True Face of AI").
    * **Subtitle (Ultra-Small · Benefit-Driven)**: Carve into the reader's pain points and hint at resolution with a concise sentence (e.g., "Why Is Your Advertising Dead?" "How to Ditch 'Tasks' and Return to 'Creation'").
    * **Composition Ratio**: Punch the eyes with the main title, stab the brain with the subtitle.

[Overall Design Definition for All Slides]
1.  **Core Theme**: Smart & pop business infotainment (intellectual curiosity × entertainment)
2.  **Color Palette**:
    * Background Color: White (#FFFFFF) or Cool Gray (#F5F5F5)
    * Text Color: Sumi (Jet Black) (#111111)
    * Accent Color: Electric Yellow (#FFCC00) or Alert Red (#FF3333)
3.  **Visual Style**:
    * Adopt the design philosophy of a "**smartphone-first economic media**."
    * Use images like "monochrome cutouts of people" or "stylish photos with blown-out backgrounds" to emphasize the subject.
    * Highlight key numbers or keywords with fluorescent marker-style lines (yellow background) to create rhythm.

4.  **Typography (Text as Graphic)**:
    * Position headlines at an "**ultra-massive size**" occupying **30%–50%** of the slide's area.
    * **Extreme Jump Ratio**: The size ratio between "headlines" and "body text" must be **10:1** or more. No half-hearted size differences allowed.
    * For Japanese headlines, use **extra-bold sans-serif** (Impact/Hiragino W8 weight) to treat them as a "surface," and tuck ultra-thin English fonts into the gaps for a sense of airiness.

5.  **Overall Structure**:
    * Strictly adhere to "1 slide = 1 message."
    * Layout is a binary choice between "negative space" or "text." Draw the eye through contrasts of text-packed areas that fill the screen and vast empty voids.
    * Place the conclusion (punchline) with a "bam!" in the center of the slide, or position it spilling off the edge for visual impact.

# presentation_design_spec_minimal_jp.yaml
# Style: Refined Minimal Portfolio
# Characteristics: Top-left navigation, aesthetics of whitespace, grid-based layout

Global Design Settings:
  Tone: "Professional, architectural, sharp-edged minimalism"
  Color Palette:
    Base: "#E9E9E9 (light gray) or #FFFFFF (white)"
    Text: "#000000 (jet black) or #333333 (dark gray)"
    Accent: "#000000 (black) – used for bold lines and emphasized text"
    Special: "Dark mode (black background) – used for slides that need emphasis"
  Typography:
    Headings: "English sans-serif (e.g., Helvetica Now, Inter). Bold and decoratively positioned."
    Body: "Japanese Gothic typeface. Small size with generous letter spacing and line height."
  Common Layout Rules:
    Navigation: "Place a small section number and title such as '01. INTRODUCTION' in the top-left (or top-right) of every slide."
    Grid: "Use a strict grid system to align elements."
    Whitespace: "Intentionally leave large areas empty (negative space) to create a sense of luxury."

Layout Variations (Catalog):
  - Type: "Title Typography"
    Design: "Scattered layout. Randomly place award badges or keywords like stamps. The central title is small, bold, and restrained."

  - Type: "Text + Data Emphasis"
    Design: "Asymmetrical split. Narrative text on the left, oversized numbers (black) on the right. Include thin divider lines."

  - Type: "Card Grid"
    Design: "Tightly spaced grid. Arrange high-quality images with a web-like interaction feel, such as text appearing on mouse-over."

  - Type: "Full-Screen Graphic"
    Design: "Office interior photography occupying the full screen (or more than half). Concrete textures, desks lined with Macs. Reduce saturation for a cool tone. Add a very small caption in the bottom-left."

  - Type: "Photo + List Split"
    Design: "50:50 split. Left: architectural or abstract photography. Right: data list (English bold headings + Japanese light-weight descriptions). Used for company info. Bold item names (English), thin body text (Japanese). Generous spacing; avoid overcrowding."

  - Type: "Minimal Map"
    Design: "Silhouette-style map. Light gray background with a white map. Use ultra-thin callout lines to indicate locations."

  - Type: "Vertical Timeline"
    Design: "Vertical axis. A single thin line with text branching left and right. Clean chronological order."

  - Type: "Bubble Chart / Venn Diagram"
    Design: "Wireframe style. Black background with thin white line art. Semi-transparent overlapping circles."

  - Type: "Dialogue (Chat Style)"
    Design: "Minimal conversational format. Not comic speech bubbles, but simple text blocks with bold speaker names."

  - Type: "Chronological List"
    Design: "Rhythmic list. Large years (e.g., 2024) on the left, descriptions on the right. Strong contrast in font sizes."

  - Type: "Dark Mode Diagram"
    Design: "Intellectual tech aesthetic. Black background with thin white lines connecting nodes. Constellation- or network-like appearance. Circles connected by fine lines or geometric patterns, expressing a fusion of technology and creativity."

  - Type: "3-Step Columns"
    Design: "Typography-driven columns. Large numbers (01, 02, 03) act as pillars. No icons; rely on typographic contrast."

  - Type: "Logo Grid"
    Design: "Monochrome grid. Convert all logos to black or gray and align them in a strict grid."

  - Type: "Two Columns (Problem vs Solution)"
    Design: "Sharp contrast. A thick black vertical line separates 'Problem' and 'Solution'. Text aligned in block form."

  - Type: "Centered Layout (Dark Mode)"
    Design: "Cinematic. A small video thumbnail or key visual centered on a black background. Add an emotional English tagline."

  - Type: "Formula / Flow Diagram"
    Design: "Mathematical style. Expressions like 'A × B = C' rendered in large serif type. Minimal arrows."

  - Type: "Arrow Steps"
    Design: "Linear process. Place text inside large arrows. High contrast (black arrows with white text)."

  - Type: "Chart"
    Design: "Precision data. Graphs with thin lines ending in small black dots. Scientific instrument-like appearance."

    Design: "Vertical or horizontal split. Ideal state in brighter tones, reality in darker tones. Boundaries remain intentionally soft."

  - Type: "City Data Overlay"
    Design: "Photography or abstract backgrounds overlaid with HUD-style data points, labels, and metrics."

    Design: "Wide, horizontal composition across multiple slides. Visual momentum and pacing prioritized over density."

    Design: "High negative space. A short English line centered or slightly off-center. Subtle gradient from dark to light or vice versa."
